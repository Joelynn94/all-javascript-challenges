[Statements] - Each instruction inside a program is called a statement. A program will be made up of a series of these statements.

[Execution Flow] - When a program is executed, the statements in it are “read” sequentially. It’s the combination of these individual results that produce the final result of the program.

[Variable] - A variable is an information storage area.

- It has three properties, it's name, it's value and it's type.
- Declaring a variable means the computer reserves memory in which to store the variable.
- Assign a value to a varible with the = (assignment operator) operator.
  [const] - is a variable declaration that you can’t reassign within the context of the block. That doesn’t mean it’s immutable. For example, array values can be changed.
  [let] - is similar to var because it can be reassigned, but unlike var, which is lexically scoped, let is block scoped.
